    "For these challenges, we will analyse song lyrics from popular artists, including BTS, Taylor Swift, Beyonce and others, using Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis. For challenge A and B, we will use the following dataset:\n",

    "[Song Lyrics dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepshah16/song-lyrics-dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is located in the directory `data_challengeA+B/`. The dataset has some duplication of songs as remixes, which will have the same or largely similar lyrics. You can attempt to deduplicate this data; otherwise, simply proceed to analyse the data but bear in mind this limitation. Also bear in mind that the lyric field sometimes also contains information about which artist is singing a lyric at any point.\n",

    "The above dataset is not suitable for sentiment analysis, because it is missing punctuation/line breaks needed to break it into smaller units. So for Challenge C, on sentiment analysis, we will look at the following dataset, which breaks the data into lines:\n",
